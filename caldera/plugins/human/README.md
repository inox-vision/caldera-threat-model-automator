# Human

Plugin supplying CALDERA with human emulation capabilities.

## Overview

The Human plugin allows you to build “humans” that will perform user actions on a target system as a means to obfuscate red actions by Caldera. Each human is built for a specific operating system and leverages the Chrome browser along with other native OS applications to perform a variety of tasks. Additionally, these humans can have various aspects of their behavior “tuned” to add randomization to the behaviors on the target system.
