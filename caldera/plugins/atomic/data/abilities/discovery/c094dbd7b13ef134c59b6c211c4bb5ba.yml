- description: 'Identify System language by checking the environment variables


    Upon successful execution, the 5 character locale result can be looked up to

    correlate the language and territory. Environment query commands are likely

    to run with a pattern match command e.g. `env | grep LANG`


    Note: `env` and `printenv` will usually provide the same results. `set` is

    also used as a builtin command that does not generate syscall telemetry but

    does provide a list of the environment variables.
