- description: 'Using Curl to download and pipe a payload to Bash. NOTE: Curl-ing
    to Bash is generally a bad idea if you don''t control the server.


    Upon successful execution, sh will download via curl and wget the specified payload
    (echo-art-fish.sh) and set a marker file in `/tmp/art-fish.txt`.
