    \ cmdl32 package is allowed to install the profile used to launch the VPN connection.\
    \ However, the config is modified to download the arbitary file. \nThe issue of\
    \ cmdl32.exe detecting and deleting the payload by identifying it as not a VPN\
    \ Servers profile is avoided by setting a temporary TMP folder and denying the\
    \ delete permission to all files for the user.\nUpon successful execution the\
