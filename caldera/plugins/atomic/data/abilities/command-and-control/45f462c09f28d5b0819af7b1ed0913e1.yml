- description: "This test simulates an infected host returning data to a command and\
    \ control server using long domain names.\nThe simulation involves sending DoH\
    \ queries that gradually increase in length until reaching the maximum length.\
    \ The intent is to test the effectiveness of detection of DoH queries for long\
    \ domain names over a set threshold.\n Upon execution, DNS information about the\
    \ domain will be displayed for each callout in a JSON format.\n"
