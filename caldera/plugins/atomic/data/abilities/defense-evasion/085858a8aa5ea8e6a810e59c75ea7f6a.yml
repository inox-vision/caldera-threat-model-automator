- description: 'RemoteFXvGPUDisablement.exe is an abusable, signed PowerShell host
    executable that was introduced in Windows 10 and Server 2019 (OS Build 17763.1339).


    One of the PowerShell functions called by RemoteFXvGPUDisablement.exe is Get-VMRemoteFXPhysicalVideoAdapter,
    a part of the Hyper-V module. This atomic test influences RemoteFXvGPUDisablement.exe
    to execute custom PowerShell code by using a technique referred to as "PowerShell
    module load-order hijacking" where a module containing, in this case, an implementation
    of the Get-VMRemoteFXPhysicalVideoAdapter is loaded first by way of introducing
    a temporary module into the first directory listed in the %PSModulePath% environment
    variable or within a user-specified module directory outside of %PSModulePath%.
    Upon execution the temporary module is deleted.


    Invoke-ATHRemoteFXvGPUDisablementCommand is used in this test to demonstrate how
    a PowerShell host executable can be directed to user-supplied PowerShell code
    without needing to supply anything at the command-line. PowerShell code execution
    is triggered when supplying the "Disable" argument to RemoteFXvGPUDisablement.exe.


    The Invoke-ATHRemoteFXvGPUDisablementCommand function outputs all relevant execution-related
    artifacts.
