- description: Adversaries may build a container image directly on a host to bypass
    defenses that monitor for the retrieval of malicious images from a public registry.
    An adversary may take advantage of that build API to build a custom image on the
    host that includes malware downloaded from their C2 server, and then they then
    may utilize Deploy Container using that custom image.
