- description: 'The ShimCache is a component in Windows operating systems that stores
    information about recently executed applications. It is used by the operating
    system to speed up the launching process of applications. The ShimCache is also
    used by IR teams and Forensic teams. Forensic investigators can use the ShimCache
    to determine which programs have been executed on a system, even if they have
    been deleted or their logs have been cleared.Reference : https://blueteamops.medium.com/shimcache-flush-89daff28d15e'
