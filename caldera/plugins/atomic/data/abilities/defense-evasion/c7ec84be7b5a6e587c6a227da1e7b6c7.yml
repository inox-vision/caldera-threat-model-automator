- description: "The following Atomic adds a registry entry to disable LSA Protection.\n\
    \nThe LSA controls and manages user rights information, password hashes and other\
    \ important bits of information in memory. Attacker tools, such as mimikatz, rely\
    \ on accessing this content to scrape password hashes or clear-text passwords.\
    \ Enabling LSA Protection configures Windows to control the information stored\
    \ in memory in a more secure fashion - specifically, to prevent non-protected\
    \ processes from accessing that data.\nUpon successful execution, the registry\
    \ will be modified and RunAsPPL will be set to 0, disabling Lsass protection.\n\
