- description: 'Copies and then runs a simple binary (just outputting "the cake is
    a lie"), that was packed by UPX.


    The UPX magic number (`0x55505821`, "`UPX!`") was changed to (`0x4c4f5452`, "`LOTR`").
    This prevents the binary from being detected

    by some methods, and especially UPX is not able to uncompress it any more.
