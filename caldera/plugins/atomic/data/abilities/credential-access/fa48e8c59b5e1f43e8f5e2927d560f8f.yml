- description: 'CAUTION! Be very careful to not exceed the password lockout threshold
    for users in the domain by running this test too frequently.

    This atomic attempts to map the IPC$ share on one of the Domain Controllers using
    a password of Spring2020 for each user in the %temp%\users.txt list. Any successful
    authentications will be printed to the screen with a message like "[*] username:password",
    whereas a failed auth will simply print a period. Use the input arguments to specify
    your own password to use for the password spray.

    Use the get_prereq_command''s to create a list of all domain users in the temp
    directory called users.txt.
