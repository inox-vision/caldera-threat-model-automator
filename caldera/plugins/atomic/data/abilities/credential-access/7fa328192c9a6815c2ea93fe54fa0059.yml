- description: 'A Kubernetes secret is an object that lets users store and manage
    sensitive information, such as passwords and connection strings in the cluster.
    Secrets can be consumed by reference in the pod configuration. Attackers who have
    permissions to retrieve the secrets from the API server (by using the pod service
    account, for example) can access sensitive information that might include credentials
    to various services or provide further access to the cluster.

    [More information about secrets](https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/configuration/secret/).


    This test will make a request to the Kubernetes api at the `/api/v1/secrets` endpoint
    requesting every secret stored within the cluster.
