- description: 'This test executes the exported function `KRShowKeyMgr` located in
    `keymgr.dll` using `rundll32.exe`. It opens a window that allows to export stored
    Windows credentials from the credential manager to a file (`.crd` by default).
    The file can then be retrieved and imported on an attacker-controlled computer
    to list the credentials get the passwords. The only limitation is that it requires
    a CTRL+ALT+DELETE input from the attacker, which can be achieve multiple ways
    (e.g. a custom implant with remote control capabilities, enabling RDP, etc.).
