- description: 'This tool allows you to dump Kerberos tickets from the LSA cache.
    Implemented via Add-Type.

    If the tool is run as a privileged user, it will automatically obtain NT AUTHORITY\SYSTEM
    privileges and then dump all tickets. If the tool is run as a non-privileged user,
    it will only dump tickets from the current logon session.
