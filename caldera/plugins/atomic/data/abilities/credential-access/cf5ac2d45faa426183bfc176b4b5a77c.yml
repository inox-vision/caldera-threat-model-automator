- description: "WerFault.exe (Windows Error Reporting process that handles process\
    \ crashes) can be abused to create a \nmemory dump of lsass.exe, in a directory\
    \ of your choice. This method relies on a mechanism \nintroduced in Windows 7\
    \ called Silent Process Exit, which provides the ability to trigger\nspecific\
    \ actions for a monitored process in one of two scenarios; either the process\
    \ terminates\nitself by calling ExitProcess(), or another process terminates it\
    \ via the TerminateProcess() API. \nThe major advantage of this technique is that\
    \ it does not cause lsass.exe to crash, and since \nWerFault.exe is used to create\
    \ file dumps all the time (not just lsass.exe), this method provides \nthe added\
    \ advantage of going undetected. WerFault.exe is a process known for dumping every\
    \ crashing process, \nfrom an attacker standpoint this is appealing as their illicit\
    \ credential extraction will \nappear benign because from a defender\u2019s viewpoint\
    \ it\u2019s within the realm of normal activity.\n\nUpon successful execution,\
    \ you should find the dump file in directory of your choice or \"%temp%\\SilentProcessExit\"\
    \ by default.\n"
