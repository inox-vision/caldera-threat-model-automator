- description: 'A Kubernetes secret is an object that lets users store and manage
    sensitive information, such as passwords and connection strings in the cluster.
    Secrets can be consumed by reference in the pod configuration. Attackers who have
    permissions to retrieve the secrets from the API server (by using the pod service
    account, for example) can access sensitive information that might include credentials
    to various services.
