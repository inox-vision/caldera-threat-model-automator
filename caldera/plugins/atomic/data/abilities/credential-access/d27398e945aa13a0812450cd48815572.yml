- description: "This test uses the MSOnline Powershell module to retrieve all user\
    \ attributes for a specified account, which can sometimes contain unsecured credentials.\
    \ \nUpon successful execution, this test will scan all user attributes for any\
    \ strings containing \"password\".\nThose unsecured credentials will be output\
    \ to a text file, as well as the account that they are associated with and the\
    \ user attribute in which they were found. \nSee: https://github.com/dafthack/CloudPentestCheatsheets/blob/master/cheatsheets/Azure.md\n"
