- description: 'The remote debugging functionality in Chrome can be used by malware
    for post-exploitation activities to obtain cookies without requiring keychain
    access. By initiating Chrome with a remote debug port, an attacker can sidestep
    encryption and employ Chrome''s own mechanisms to access cookies.


    If successful, this test will output a list of cookies.


    Note: Chrome processes will be killed during this test.
