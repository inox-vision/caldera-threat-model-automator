- description: 'Deletes Windows Volume Shadow Copies. This technique is used by numerous
    ransomware families and APT malware such as Olympic Destroyer. Upon

    execution, if no shadow volumes exist the message "No items found that satisfy
    the query." will be displayed. If shadow volumes are present, it

    will delete them without printing output to the screen. This is because the /quiet
    parameter was passed which also suppresses the y/n

    confirmation prompt. Shadow copies can only be created on Windows server or Windows
    8.
