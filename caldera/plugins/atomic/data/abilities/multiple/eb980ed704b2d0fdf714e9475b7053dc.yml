- description: 'The UUIDs Process Injection code was first introduced by the NCC Group.
    The code can be stored in UUID forms on the heap and converted back to binary
    via UuidFromStringA at runtime. In this new custom version of UUID injection,
    EnumSystemLocalesA is the only API called to execute the code. We used custom
    UuidToString and UuidFromString implementations to avoid using UuidFromStringA
    and RPCRT4.dll, thereby eliminating the static signatures. This technique also
    avoided the use of VirtualAlloc, WriteProcessMemory and CreateThread


    The injected shellcode will open a message box and a notepad.
