- description: "This atomic will create a new IAM role. The default role permissions\
    \ are: *IAM Service Account Get*. The idea for this Atomic came from a Rule published\
    \ by the Elastic team.\n\nIdentifies an Identity and Access Management (IAM) custom\
    \ role creation in Google Cloud Platform (GCP). \nCustom roles are user-defined,\
    \ and allow for the bundling of one or more supported permissions to meet specific\
    \ needs. \nCustom roles will not be updated automatically and could lead to privilege\
    \ creep if not carefully scrutinized.\n\nThis atomic will create a new IAM role.\
    \ The default role permissions are: *IAM Service Account Get*\n\nReference: https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules/blob/main/rules/integrations/gcp/initial_access_gcp_iam_custom_role_creation.toml\n"
