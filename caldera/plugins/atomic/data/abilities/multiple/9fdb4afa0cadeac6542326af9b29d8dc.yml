- description: "Pluggable Access Module, which is present on all modern Linux systems,\
    \ generally contains a library called pam_tty_audit.so which logs all keystrokes\
    \ for the selected users and sends it to audit.log.  All terminal activity on\
    \ any new logins would then be archived and readable by an adversary with elevated\
    \ privledges.\n\nPasswords hidden by the console can also be logged, with 'log_passwd'\
    \ as in this example.  If root logging is enabled, then output from any process\
    \ which is later started by root is also logged, even if this policy is carefully\
    \ enabled (e.g. 'disable=*' as the initial command).\n\nUse 'aureport --tty' or\
    \ other audit.d reading tools to read the log output, which is binary.  Mac OS\
    \ does not currently contain the pam_tty_audit.so library. \n"
