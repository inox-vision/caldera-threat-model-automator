- description: 'Kubernetes Job is a controller that creates one or more pods and ensures
    that a specified number of them successfully terminate. Kubernetes Job can be
    used to run containers that perform finite tasks for batch jobs. Kubernetes CronJob
    is used to schedule Jobs. Attackers may use Kubernetes CronJob for scheduling
    execution of malicious code that would run as a container in the cluster.
