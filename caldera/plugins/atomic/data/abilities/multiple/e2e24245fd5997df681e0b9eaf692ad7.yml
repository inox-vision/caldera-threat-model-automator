- description: "This Atomic will: \n  - Create a service account\n  - Create a service\
    \ account key, \n  - Store the result of retrieving a single key for that service\
    \ account as a variable\n  - Pass that variable for deletion\n  - Delete the service\
    \ account\n\nThe idea for this Atomic came from a Rule published by the Elastic\
    \ team.\n\nIdentifies the deletion of an Identity and Access Management (IAM)\
    \ service account key in Google Cloud Platform (GCP).\nEach service account is\
    \ associated with two sets of public/private RSA key pairs that are used to authenticate.\
    \ \nIf a key is deleted, the application will no longer be able to access Google\
    \ Cloud resources using that key. A security best practice is to rotate your service\
    \ account keys regularly.\n\nReference: https://github.com/elastic/detection-rules/blob/main/rules/integrations/gcp/impact_gcp_storage_bucket_deleted.toml\n"
