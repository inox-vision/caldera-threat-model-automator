- description: "When a command is executed in bash, the BASH_COMMAND variable contains\
    \ that command. For example :~$ echo $BASH_COMMAND = \"echo $BASH_COMMAND\". The\
    \ trap command is not a external command, but a built-in function of bash and\
    \ can be used in a script to run a bash function when some event occurs. trap\
    \ will detect when the BASH_COMMAND variable value changes and then pipe that\
    \ value into a file, creating a bash session based keylogger. \n\nTo gain persistence\
    \ the command could be added to the users .bashrc or .bash_aliases or the systems\
    \ default .bashrc in /etc/skel/ \n"
