- description: 'This program executes shellcode in the current process using the following
    steps

    1. Allocate memory for the shellcode with VirtualAlloc setting the page permissions
    to Read/Write

    2. Use the RtlCopyMemory macro to copy the shellcode to the allocated memory space

    3. Change the memory page permissions to Execute/Read with VirtualProtect

    4. Call CreateThread on shellcode address

    5. Call WaitForSingleObject so the program does not end before the shellcode is
    executed


    This program loads the DLLs and gets a handle to the used procedures itself instead
    of using the windows package directly.
