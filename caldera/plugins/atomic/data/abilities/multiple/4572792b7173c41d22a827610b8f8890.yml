- description: "The following Atomic will modify an undocumented registry key that\
    \ may be abused to load a arbitrary DLL into LSASS. \n\nUpon execution, the registry\
    \ key will be modified and a value will contain the path to the DLL. \nReference:\

    Note that if any LSA based protection is enabled, this will most likely not be\
    \ successful with LSASS.exe loading the DLL.\n"
