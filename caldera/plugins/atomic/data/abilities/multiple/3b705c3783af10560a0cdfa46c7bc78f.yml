- description: "There are several variables that can be set to control the appearance\
    \ of the bash command prompt: PS1, PS2, PS3, PS4 and PROMPT_COMMAND. The contents\
    \ of these variables are executed as if they had been typed on the command line.\
    \ The PROMPT_COMMAND variable \"if set\" will be executed before the PS1 variable\
    \ and can be configured to write the latest \"bash history\" entries to the syslog.\n\
    \nTo gain persistence the command could be added to the users .bashrc or .bash_aliases\
    \ or the systems default .bashrc in /etc/skel/ \n"
