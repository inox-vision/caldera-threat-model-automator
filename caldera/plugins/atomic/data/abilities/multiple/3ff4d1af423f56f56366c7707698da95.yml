- description: "AppInit_DLLs is a mechanism that allows an arbitrary list of DLLs\
    \ to be loaded into each user mode process on the system. Upon succesfully execution,\
    \ \nyou will see the message \"The operation completed successfully.\" Each time\
    \ the DLL is loaded, you will see a message box with a message of \"Install AppInit\
    \ Shim DLL was called!\" appear.\nThis will happen regularly as your computer\
    \ starts up various applications and may in fact drive you crazy. A reliable way\
    \ to make the message box appear and verify the \nAppInit Dlls are loading is\
    \ to start the notepad application. Be sure to run the cleanup commands afterwards\
    \ so you don't keep getting message boxes showing up.\n\nNote: If secure boot\
    \ is enabled, this technique will not work. https://docs.microsoft.com/en-us/windows/win32/dlls/secure-boot-and-appinit-dlls\n"
