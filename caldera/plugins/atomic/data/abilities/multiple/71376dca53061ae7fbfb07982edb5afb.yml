- description: 'Create a scheduled task through manipulation of registry keys. This
    procedure is implemented using the [GhostTask](https://github.com/netero1010/GhostTask)
    utility. By manipulating registry keys under HKLM\SOFTWARE\Microsoft\Windows NT\CurrentVersion\Schedule\TaskCache\Tree,
    the tool creates user-specified scheduled tasks without a corresponding Windows
    Event 4698, which is logged when scheduled tasks are created through conventional
    means.

    This requires a download of the GhostTask binary, which must be run as NT Authority\SYSTEM.
    Upon successful execution of this test, a scheduled task will be set to run at
    logon which launches notepad.exe or runs a user-specified command.

    For further exploration of this procedure and guidance for hunting and detection,
    see [Hunting G-G-G-GhostTasks!](https://medium.com/p/154b50ab6a78).
