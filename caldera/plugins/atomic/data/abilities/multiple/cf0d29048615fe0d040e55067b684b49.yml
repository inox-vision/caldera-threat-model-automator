- description: "The Bash shell runs ~/.bash_logout \"if it exists\" to run commands\
    \ on user logout. An adversary may create or append to a .bash_logout to clear\
    \ history, start processes etc. Note the ~/.bash_logout is only run if you explicitly\
    \ exit or log out of an \"interactive login shell session\" i.e. via the console,\
    \ SSH, /bin/bash -l or su -l <username>. \n\nThis test creates the art user, logs\
    \ in, creates a .bash_logout which will echo some text into the art.txt file on\
    \ logout and logs out and the /home/art/art.txt is created.\n"
